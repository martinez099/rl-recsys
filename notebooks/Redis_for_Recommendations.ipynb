    "> David is a creative Software Engineer and a skilled Consultant with experiences in software project management, for both product development and customer projects. Furthermore he has a strong database background by being specialized on NoSQL database systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "My experience is mainly based on my work as Senior Software Engineer, Project Lead, Software Architect, Consultant, Principal Solutions Engineer, Performance Architect for database companies like Ingres, sones (GraphDB), Couchbase or Redis Labs. As you can see, it's not my daily business to work on recommender systems (recommendation engines). I am more a database guy who loves to write code (even if I don't find too much time at the moment).\n",

    "\n",
    "Think it's a good idea to mention what Redis actually is, whereby Redis is very popular and so most of you might already know what it is. Here a ranking of the most popular database systems (just to highlight how popular Redis is):\n",
    "\n",
    "* https://db-engines.com/en/ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "As Redis Enterprise is adding a bunch of cool features, I am also expaining in very short words what the benefit could be to use Redis Enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis Labs is the home of OSS Redis and the provider of the multi-model in-memory database system 'Redis Enterprise'. Redis Enterprise is based on Redis Open Source and is providing the following addtional features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Easier Operability**: Admin Web UI, Admin REST Service, several CLI tools, Redis Enterprise Cloud (Hosted or VPC), Enterprise Support\n",
    "* **Enhanced High Availability**: Node based quorum, rack-tone awareness, disaster recovery, periodic backup, faster failover times and different watchdog profiles, ...\n",
    "* **Improved Scalability and Consistent Performance**: Multiple Redis shards behind a single endpoint, different shards placement policies, built-in resource management for better resource isolation, multi-tenancy, Tunable frontend thread management, ...\n",
    "* **Active-Active Geo-replicated Databases**: By leveraging Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (resetable PN-Counters, OR-Sets, LW-wins Register, causual consistency via Vector Clocks)\n",
    "* **Redis on Flash**: Uses Flash drives as RAM extension in order to store more data at lower costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition Redis Labs is maintaining the following modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RediSearch**: Search engine over Redis\n",
    "* **Redis-ML**: Machine Learning Model Server\n",
    "* **Redis Graph**: Graph database with an Open Cypher-based query language\n",
    "* **ReJSON**: A JSON data type for Redis\n",
    "* **ReBloom**: Scalable Bloom filters\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code of all of these modules is available on Github."
